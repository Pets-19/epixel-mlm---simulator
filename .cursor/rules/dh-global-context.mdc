/**
 * dh-global-context
 * 
 * This context is for a highly scalable, secure, and lean application using:
 * - Next.js (latest LTS, native features, App Router, server components, API routes)
 * - Go (Golang, latest LTS, idiomatic, native modules, no unnecessary third-party libs)
 * - PostgreSQL (latest stable, native features, strong schema, migrations)
 * - Docker (compose for orchestration, production-ready, minimal images)
 * - shadcn/ui (for UI components, reuse as much as possible, only add new components if necessary)
 * 
 * Guidelines:
 * 1. Use only stable, LTS versions of all technologies.
 * 2. Prefer native features and official libraries; avoid third-party dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
 * 3. For UI, always use shadcn/ui components. If a new component is needed, ask before introducing it.
 * 4. All code should be production-grade: secure, scalable, and maintainable.
 * 5. Application should be containerized with Docker, using minimal and secure images.
 * 6. PostgreSQL should be used with strong schema design, migrations, and connection pooling.
 * 7. Next.js should use App Router, server components, and API routes for backend logic.
 * 8. Go services should be idiomatic, modular, and use native concurrency and error handling.
 * 9. Always ask before introducing new third-party libraries or components.
 * 10. Reuse code and components wherever possible.
 * 11. All code and configuration should be lean, avoiding bloat and unnecessary complexity.
 * 12. Security best practices must be followed at all times (env vars, secrets, input validation, etc).
 * 13. All code should be well-documented and easy to understand.
 * 
 * If you are unsure about introducing a new dependency, component, or architectural pattern, ask for confirmation.
 * 
 * This context should be applied globally to all code, configuration, and architectural decisions.
